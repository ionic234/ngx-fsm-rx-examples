  <hr />
  <h2>Part 2: Creating a Simple Traffic Light component with FsmRx</h2>
  
  <p>In this article we will learn how to build a Simple Traffic Light component using <b>FsmRx</b>. 
  Specifically, we will be using the <b>Angular</b> wrapper <b>NgxFsmRx</b>, which contains the required base functionality to define <b>Angular</b> injectables, services and components.
  <b>FsmRx</b> can be added to an <b>Angular</b> project of version 16 and above using the following command: </p> 

  ```shell
  ng add ngx-fsm-rx
  ``` 

  <p><i>Disclaimer: These articles include examples intended to showcase the functionalities of <b>FsmRx</b> rather than accurately depict real-world traffic control systems. 
  The choice of traffic lights as examples is based on their widespread familiarity. 
  Actual traffic control systems are significantly more complex than the simplified illustrations provided in this documentation.</i></p>  

  <p>This <b>"ngx-fsm-rx-examples"</b> project takes advantage of <b>Storybook</b>, a front-end code playground for previewing and experimenting with front-end components.
  <b>Storybook</b> provides a web interface where the completed example components can be viewed. 
  In the vernacular of <b>Storybook</b>, these examples are presented as stories. 
  Stories allow for the setting of an <b>FsmRxComponent</b> inputs and default values through the use of <code>arg</code> controls, facilitating testing, experimentation and prototyping.</p>

  <p>Inside <b>Storybook</b> we can also take advantage of an <b>NgxFsmRx</b> component called <b>FsmRxDebugSetComponent</b>. 
  This component wraps <b>FsmRxComponents</b>, providing state diagrams and changelogs for use in the test environment.
  The use of <b>FsmRxDebugSetComponent</b> will be discussed further in ["Part 5: Debugging FsmRxComponents using Storybook"](?path=/docs/5-debugging-fsmrxcomponents-using-storybook--docs).</p>

  <div class="breakout-box examples">
    <p>The complete code for the following ["Traffic Light Simple"](?path=/story/examples-1-traffic-light-simple--default) <br/> example story can be found in the folder <br/><b>"/projects/ngx-fsm-rx-examples/src/stories/traffic-light-simple"</b>.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Defining FSM states</h3>  

  <p>The first step to creating any <b>FsmRx</b> derived class, is to identify and define the states that the FSM can be in. 
  As previously discussed, a simple three-light traffic light can be in one of three states at any given time. These states are <b>"go"</b>, <b>"prepareToStop"</b> and <b>"stop"</b>.
  In <b>FsmRx</b> classes these states are defined as a union of string literals: </p>
  
  ```typescript

  type TrafficLightStates = "go" | "prepareToStop" | "stop";
  ```

  <p>While you are free to name your states almost anything you want, <b>FsmRx</b> reserves two state names for internal use only. These restricted states are <b>"FSMInit"</b> and <b>"FSMTerminate"</b>.
  <b>"FSMInit"</b> is the state that <b>FsmRx</b> will initialise in. This state cannot be provided with custom data, and it is not possible to re-enter once it has been left. <b>"FSMTerminate"</b> represents the final state in a Terminating FSM.
  A key rule of <b>FsmRx</b> is that every state must define at least one other state they can transition to. While it is not possible to transition to the <b>"FSMTerminate"</b> state, it is required to designate a state as the final state in an FSM. 
  <b>"FSMTerminate"</b> has no meaning if it is not the only state that can be transitioned to. If you try to use either <b>"FSMInit"</b> or <b>"FSMTerminate" </b> as a name for your custom states <b>TypeScript</b> will error unless they are removed. </p>

  <div className="breakout-box">
    
    <h3>What is a Literal Type?</h3>
    
    <p>A literal type is a type that represents a fixed value rather than a general classification of data. Take the following examples:</p>
    
    ```ts
    const anyNumber: number = 1000 //accepts any valid number value
    const fixedNumber: 3000 = 3000 //only accepts the number 3000

    const anyString: string = "hello" //accept any valid string value
    const fixedString: "world" = "world" //only accept the string world
    ```
    
    <p>Literal types ensure that a property/variable can only be assigned specific data. Attempting to assign an invalid value will throw an error, for example: </p>
    
    <figure>
      <div class = "figure-content">
        <img src={literalTypeErrors} alt="Literal type errors" />
      </div>
    </figure>

    <p>Literal types are not restricted to just one value. With the use of unions, literal types can define a set of valid values that can be assigned to the property/variable:</p>
    
    ```ts
    const fixedNumber: 1000 | 2000 | 3000 = 3000 //only accepts the numbers 1000, 2000 or 3000
    const fixedString: "hello" | "world" = "world" //only accepts the strings "hello" or "world"
    ```

    <p>Literal types greatly improve type safety and enable a feature called type narrowing, which is discussed further in ["Part 4: Reacting to user input"](?path=/docs/4-reacting-to-user-input--docs).</p>
  
  </div>

  <h3>Defining FSM State Data</h3>  

  <p>With the FSMs state union established, the next step is to define an object type to describe the data associated with each state.</p>

  <p>A key feature of FSMs is that each state has access to its own unique dataset, which in <b>FsmRx</b> is referred to as <code>stateData</code>.
  This <code>stateData</code> includes the specific state they represent, along with any necessary additional variables.
  Different states <code>stateData</code> may be very similar, only varying in just their state value, or define data unique to their particular state.
  For a state transition to occur, it must be provided with the correct <code>stateData</code> object.</p>

  <p>For this traffic light example, each state requires access to the same data - the name of the state and an object containing numerical literals that specify the duration the system remains in any given state.</p> 
  
  <p>In <b>FsmRx</b> it is a requirement that <code>stateData</code> objects are strongly typed through the use of object types. 
  These type objects contain any data required by the FSM states but must also define the property <code>state</code> typed as the FSMs state union. 
  This can be achieved manually or by extending <code>BaseStateData</code>, which is a generic type that takes the FSMs state union as its parameter and uses it to define the required <code>state</code> property.</p>

  <p>For this traffic light commponent the <code>stateData</code> type is defined as follows:</p> 
  
 ```typescript
  type TrafficLightTimings = {
    go: 7000,
    prepareToStop: 3000,
    stop: 10000;
  };

  interface TrafficLightData extends BaseStateData<TrafficLightStates> {
    trafficLightTimings: TrafficLightTimings; 
  }
  ```
  
  <p>More complex <code>stateData</code> definitions, where states require access to unique data will be discussed in ["Part 4: Reacting to user input"](?path=/docs/4-reacting-to-user-input--docs).</p>

  <h3>Defining FSM State Transitions</h3>  
  
  <p>The final required type is an object type, which contains an entry for each of the states, including <b>"FSMInit"</b>, describing the states that they can leave to.</p>
  
  ```typescript
  type TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap = {
    FSMInit: "go",
    go: "prepareToStop",
    prepareToStop: "stop",
    stop: "go";
  };
  ```
  <p>The above type defines a circular FSM that starts at <b>"FSMInit"</b> before traversing to <b>"go"</b> where it loops indefinitely around the standard traffic light sequence of <b>"go"->"prepareToStop"->"stop"->"go"</b>.</p> 

  <figure>
    <div class = "figure-content">
      <img src={trafficLightSimpleStateDiagram} alt="Traffic Light State Diagram" style={{ padding: '10px 30px 8px 20px', width: '170px' }} />
      <figcaption>The state diagram resulting from the <code>TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap</code> definition.</figcaption>
    </div>
  </figure>

  <p>As previously stated, all states must transition to at least one other state. If a state is not defined in this object type then <b>FsmRx</b> will determine that it can leave to all other states.
  <b>FsmRx</b> also will generate type errors when it identifies orphan states, which are states that no other state can leave to. 
  This structure is enforced via both compile-time type checking and <b>RxJS</b> filters executed at runtime.</p>
  
  <h3>Extending FsmRx Classes</h3>

  <p>These types can now be incorporated into the component class declaration by extending the abstract class <b>FsmRxComponent</b> and passing them in as type parameters.</p>
  
  ```typescript 
  export class TrafficLightSimpleComponent extends FsmRxComponent<
    TrafficLightStates,
    TrafficLightData,
    TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap
  > implements AfterViewInit {
    ...
  }
  ```
  
  <div className="breakout-box">
    <h3>Why Inheritance Instead of Composition?</h3>
    <p>There is a generally accepted maxim in software development that composition should be favoured over inheritance. 
    While this is true for most scenarios, the requirements of <b>FsmRx</b> mean it is better suited to the inheritance model.</p>
    <p>The compositon over inheritance philosophy favours a <b>has-a</b> approach over an <b>is-a</b> approach. 
    However this doesn't fit with <b>FsmRx</b> derived classes as they don't have an FSM, they are an FSM. 
    All of the states and data used to control an FSM belong to the class itself not a third party. 
    Adopting a <b>has-a</b> design would mean classes lose control of their own data.</p>
    <p>An inheritance-based approach also comes with a few benefits:</p>  
    <ol>
      <li><b>Framework Agnostic</b>: As the core <b>FsmRx</b> module is designed to be framework agnostic it was necessary to avoid all framework-specific boilerplate. 
      As different frameworks have different requirements for composition it would be difficult to support at the core level.</li>
      <li><b>Simplicity</b>: The use of abstract properties to enforce the declaration of required properties is arguably simpler than setting up providers for multiple instances of the same service.</li>
      <li><b>Custom Overrides</b>: Inheritance allows for easier overriding of functions to provide bespoke logic. This is especially useful for extending <b>FsmRx's</b> default diagram logic.</li>
      <li><b>Storybook Integration </b>: <b>FsmRxComponent</b> exposes several functions that allow <b>Storybook</b> to display state diagrams and logging tools.
       If composition was used these functions would have to be manually exposed for every <b>FsmRxComponent</b> subclass.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A compositional approach could be taken by extending <code>FsmRxInjectable</code> or <b>FsmRxComponent</b> into a service, but this has the potential to create more problems than it would solve.</p>
  </div>

  <p>When extending an <b>FsmRx</b> class, it is a requirement that a constructor is defined. 
  This constructor can take in two optional parameters that are used to configure the FSM, <code>fsmConfig</code> and <code>isInDevMode</code>.
  The <code>fsmConfig</code> parameter allows for the configuring of <b>fsmRx</b> features and will be discussed further in ["Part 5: Debugging FsmRxComponents using Storybook"](?path=/docs/5-debugging-fsmrxcomponents-using-storybook--docs). 
  The <code>isInDevMode</code> parameter forces <b>fsmRx</b> to run as if it were in either a development or production environment.
  For the following example components, however, the default constructor is sufficient.
  All <b>fsmRx</b> constructors must call <code>super()</code> for the FSMs to correctly initialize.</p> 

  ```typescript 
   public constructor() {
    super();
  }
  ```

  <h3>Defining State Metadata via the <code>stateMap</code> property</h3>

  <p>All classes that extend <b>FsmRx</b> must define the abstract property <code>stateMap</code>. This <code>stateMap</code> property acts as the DNA of an FSM and defines the metadata for every state.
  This metadata is comprised of two mandatory properties <code>canEnterFromStates</code> and <code>canLeaveToStates</code> and three optional lifecycle hooks: <code>onEnter</code>, <code>onLeave</code> and <code>onUpdate</code>.</p>

  <p>As typing information is only available during development and at compile time, it is a requirement to replicate the <code>TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap</code> into <b>JavaScript</b> properties that are available at runtime.
  This is done through the declaration of the <code>canEnterFromStates</code> and <code>canLeaveToStates</code> objects. 
  These are strongly typed objects that ensure an entry for each valid state is present. 
  The values assigned to these state keys are insignificant and have been typed as the boolean literal <code>true</code>. 
  In <b>VS Code</b>, you can utilize the shortcut <code>ctrl+space</code> to promptly define these objects using the <b>IntelliSense</b> menu.</p>    
  
  ```typescript
  protected override stateMap: StateMap<
    TrafficLightStates,
    TrafficLightData,
    TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap
  > = {
      go: {
        canEnterFromStates: { FSMInit: true, stop: true },
        canLeaveToStates: { prepareToStop: true },
      },
      prepareToStop: {
        canEnterFromStates: { go: true },
        canLeaveToStates: { stop: true },
      },
      stop: {
        canEnterFromStates: { prepareToStop: true },
        canLeaveToStates: { go: true },
      }
    };
  ```

  <h3>Using FsmRx in a Component Template</h3>

  <p>As <b>FsmRx</b> is built upon <b>RxJS</b> access to the state data can be gained through the use of the async pipe. 
  For this purpose, <b>FsmRx</b> exposes an observable called <b>stateData$</b> which provides the data for the current state. 
  This acts similarly to a <code>ViewBag</code> in <b>ASP</b> and greatly simplifies component templates.</p>

  <p>The traffic light <b>HTML</b> template contains a list of three items, each representing a light on the traffic light. 
  The <b>state</b> property of the <b>stateData</b> observable is used in combination with <code>ngClass</code> to apply the <b>"on"</b> class to the light that corresponds to the FSMs current state.</p> 
  
  ```html
  <div class="traffic-light-housing"
    *ngIf="stateData$ | async as stateData">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="red"
          [ngClass]="{'on':stateData.state === 'stop'}"></span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="amber"
          [ngClass]="{'on':stateData.state === 'prepareToStop'}"></span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="green"
          [ngClass]="{'on':stateData.state === 'go'}"></span>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  ```

  <p>In the <b>CSS</b> these lights have a filter applied to them which makes them appear off. 
  When the <b>"on"</b> class is applied, the brightness of this filter is set to 1 making them appear as if they were on. 
  The <b>CSS</b> is outside the scope of this article but can be viewed in the <b>"ngx-fsm-rx-examples"</b> project of the <b>NgxFsmRx</b> repository.</p>

  <h3>Transitioning to the first State</h3>

  <p>As an <b>FsmRx</b> FSM will always start in the dataless <b>"FSMInit"</b> state, the first task is to change the state to a valid custom FSM state. 
  This can either be done in the class constructor or as part of an <b>Angular</b> initialisation lifecycle hook. 
  When creating a <b>FsmRxComponent</b> it is advisable to use the hook <code>ngAfterViewInit</code> as the assigned <code>@Input</code> values will be available, reducing the need to update the state in <code>ngOnChanges</code>. 
  This also helps with <b>Storybook</b> integration (see ["Part 5: Debugging FsmRxComponents using Storybook"](?path=/docs/5-debugging-fsmrxcomponents-using-storybook--docs)) as <code>arg</code> defaults are also assigned before this hook is called.</p>

  <p>While it is not strictly necessary, it is always recommended to be in the <b>FsmRx</b> context when executing any FSM transition. 
  The program is said to be in the <b>FsmRx</b> context when it has access to the current state's information data. 
  The <code>currentState$</code> getter is used to enter the <b>FsmRx</b> context from outside of the <code>OnEnter</code>, <code>OnLeave</code> or <code>OnUpdate</code> lifecycle hooks.
  This method returns an observable that emits the <code>CurrentStateInfo</code> of the current state before completing.</p>

  ```ts
  public override ngAfterViewInit(): void {
    super.ngAfterViewInit();
    this.currentState$.subscribe((currentStateInfo: CurrentStateInfo<TrafficLightStates, TrafficLightData, TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap>) => {
      ...
    });
  }

  ```
  <p>Being in the <b>FsmRx</b> context provides certainty of the current state and gives more accurate code-hinting.
  This helps to prevent potential rejections from being triggered by unauthorized state transitions.
  Using <code>CurrentStateInfo</code> also helps to make your intentions more explicit and understandable.</p>

  <p>With the <b>FsmRx</b> context established, the current state is used to test that the FSM is in the expected <b>"FSMInit"</b> state. 
  If it is then the state can be changed to the desired <b>"go"</b> state.
  This is done by calling the <code>changeState</code> function, passing in the required data.</p>
  
  ```typescript 
  this.currentState$.subscribe((currentStateInfo: CurrentStateInfo<TrafficLightStates, TrafficLightData, TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap>) => {
    const { state } = currentStateInfo;
    if (state === "FSMInit") {
      this.changeState<FSMInit>({ state: "go", trafficLightTimings: { go: 7000, prepareToStop: 3000, stop: 10000 } });
    }
  });
  ```

  <p>As part of this change state request, the transition is checked to ensure it is valid. 
  If the transition is rejected the FSM will remain in its current state and an optional warning may be logged to the console.
  If the transition is successful, the traffic light will advance to its <b>"go"</b> state and look like this: </p>

   <figure>
    <div class = "figure-content">
      <img src={trafficLightSimpleGoState} alt="Traffic Light in Go State" />
      <figcaption>The traffic light in its <b>"go"</b> state.</figcaption>
    </div>
  </figure>

  <p>The <code>changeState</code> function supports an optional type parameter that specifies the expected current state value within the FSM. 
  When this type parameter is omitted, <code>changeState</code> permits data for any state within the FSM. 
  However, when this parameter is provided, <code>changeState</code> utilizes the current state's entry in its <code>CanLeaveToMap</code> to confine the data to only valid states. 
  This behaviour enhances <b>IntelliSense</b> functionality resulting in increased type safety while transitioning states.</p>

  <figure>
    <div class = "figure-content">
      <img src={changeStateTypeParameter} alt="changeState type parameter" />
    </div>
  </figure>

  <h3>State Transition Lifecycle Hooks</h3>

  <p><b>FsmRx</b> allows for the execution of custom code during <code>changeState</code> and <code>updateState</code> transitions via the use of lifecycle hooks.</p>
  <p>These hooks are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>onLeave</code>: Called first during <code>changeState</code> transitions, this hook is used to handle the teardown operations specific to the state you're leaving. 
    It is where tasks such as cancelling timers, unbinding events, or any other necessary cleanup operations are performed before moving to the next state.</li>
    <li><code>onEnter</code>: This hook is called last during <code>changeState</code> transitions and is used to perform any necessary buildup logic for the state being entered. 
    This could involve activities like initialising timers, binding events, making API calls, or any other actions needed to prepare for the new state.</li>
    <li><code>onUpdate</code>: is used to perform any required side effects during <code>updateState</code> transitions such as playing animations, sounds and triggering events.</li>
  </ul>
 
  <p>These hooks receive a state change data argument that describes the current transition. 
  They are called <code>OnLeaveStateChanges</code>, <code>OnEnterStateChanges</code> and <code>OnUpdateStateChanges</code>  and are typed as follows:</p>

  ```typescript
  OnLeaveStateChanges<TrafficLightStates, "go", TrafficLightData, TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap>
  OnEnterStateChanges<TrafficLightStates, "go", TrafficLightData, TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap>
  OnUpdateStateChanges<TrafficLightStates, "go", TrafficLightData, TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap>
  ```

  <p>These data types contain the hook they relate to and properties to describe the before and after states of the transition. 
  For <code>OnLeaveStateChanges</code> and <code>OnEnterStateChanges</code> these properties are called <code>leavingStateInfo</code> and <code>enteringStateInfo</code> while for <code>OnUpdateStateChanges</code> they are named <code>previousInfo</code> and <code>updateInfo</code>.
  Regardless of name, they each contain the following properties:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>state</b>: The string literal of the state the info relates to.</li>
    <li><b>stateData</b>: The data relevant to this state.</li>
    <li><b>canLeaveTo</b>: An array of the states this state can leave to</li>
    <li><b>canUpdate</b>: A boolean value that declares whether the state can be updated or not. This value is always true except for the <b>"FSMInit"</b> state.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This gives access to all the data required to control the flow of the FSM.</p>

  <p>These lifecycle hooks are specified within the <b>stateMap</b> and can be represented as either an inline function or method calls.</p>

  <h3>Defining an onEnter Hook for the Traffic lights "go" State</h3>

  <p>Having successfully transitioned to the <b>"go"</b> state, the next step is to determine the duration for how long the FSM should remain in this state before transitioning to the next.
  This can be done by leveraging the <b>"go"</b> states <b>"onEnter"</b> lifecycle hook in the following manner:</p>

  ```ts
  protected override stateMap: StateMap<
    TrafficLightStates,
    TrafficLightData,
    TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap
  > = {
      go: {
        ...
        onEnter: (onEnterStateChanges: OnEnterStateChanges<TrafficLightStates, "go", TrafficLightData, TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap>) => {
          ...
        }
      },
      ...
    };
  ```

  <p>The duration to wait in this state can be determined by consulting the <code>trafficLightTiming</code> property of the state data. 
  As previously mentioned, this data can be retrieved from the <code>OnEnterStateChanges</code> argument either directly or via object destructuring:</p> 
  ```ts
  onEnter: (onEnterStateChanges: OnEnterStateChanges<TrafficLightStates, "go", TrafficLightData, TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap>) => {
    const trafficLightTimings = onEnterStateChanges.enteringStateInfo.stateData.trafficLightTimings
  }
  ```
  <p>or</p>
  ```ts
  onEnter: (onEnterStateChanges: OnEnterStateChanges<TrafficLightStates, "go", TrafficLightData, TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap>) => {
    const { enteringStateInfo } = onEnterStateChanges;
    const { stateData } = enteringStateInfo;
    const { trafficLightTimings } = stateData;
  }

  ```

  <p>This <b>"go"</b> state timing data is supplied to the <b>RxJS</b> <code>timer</code> function.
  This function returns an observable that waits for the specified period before emitting and completing. 
  Subscribing to this emission allows the <code>changeState</code> function to be called, advancing to the <b>"prepareToStop"</b> state after the specified delay.
  Given that all states share identical data, the spread operator can be used to supply this function with the current <code>stateData</code>, altering only the state property to reflect the desired next state.
  As the timer observable automatically completes after emitting, there is no need for an <code>onLeave</code> cleanup function to handle unsubscribing or any other cleanup operations.</p>

  ```typescript
  onEnter: (onEnterStateChanges: OnEnterStateChanges<TrafficLightStates, "go", TrafficLightData, TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap>) => {
    const { enteringStateInfo } = onEnterStateChanges;
    const { stateData } = enteringStateInfo;
    const { trafficLightTimings } = stateData;

    timer(trafficLightTimings["go"])
      .subscribe(() => {
        this.changeState<"go">({
          ...stateData,
          state: "prepareToStop"
        });
      });
  }
  ```

  <h3>Finalising the Simple Traffic Light component</h3>

  <p>Finally all that is required to complete the traffic light component is to write the hook logic for the other two states.
  While it would be possible to create a change state function for each required state, this would be quite redundant as each state performs the exact same steps. 
  They are:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Extract the current state duration from the <code>TrafficLightTimings</code> property.</li>
    <li>Create a timer to wait for this duration.</li>
    <li>Transition to the next state in the chain.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This can be achieved by updating the code to use a method call, rather than an inline function, and applying it to all of the states <code>OnEnter</code> hooks.
  For this purpose, the <code>OnEnterStateChanges</code> type accepts a union of states as its second type parameter allowing it to represent multiple types of state data.</p> 
  
  ```typescript
  protected override stateMap: StateMap<
    TrafficLightStates,
    TrafficLightData,
    TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap
  > = {
      go: {
        ...
        onEnter: this.handleEnterState
      },
      prepareToStop: {
        ...
        onEnter: this.handleEnterState
      },
      stop: {
        ...
        onEnter: this.handleEnterState
      }
    };
  
    private handleEnterState(
      onEnterStateChanges: OnEnterStateChanges<TrafficLightStates, TrafficLightStates, TrafficLightData, TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap>
    ): void {
      ...
    }

  ```
  <p>To successfully transition to the next state, two pieces of data are required: the current state and the intended next state.
  The <code>enteringStateInfo</code> contains the properties: <code>state</code>, representing the name of the upcoming new state, and
  <code>canLeaveTo</code>, an array containing all the states to which a future transition is possible.</p>

  <p>As each of the Simple Traffic Lights states can only exit to one other state, the first entry in the <code>canLeaveTo</code> array is the name of the destination state.</p>

  ```typescript
  private handleEnterState(
    onEnterStateChanges: OnEnterStateChanges<TrafficLightStates, TrafficLightStates, TrafficLightData, TrafficLightCanLeaveToMap>
  ): void {

    const { enteringStateInfo } = onEnterStateChanges;
    const { stateData, state, canLeaveTo } = enteringStateInfo;
    const { trafficLightTimings } = stateData;

    timer(trafficLightTimings[state])
      .subscribe(() => {
        this.changeState({
          ...stateData,
          state: canLeaveTo[0]
        });
      });
  }
  ```
  <h3>Generating <b>FsmRxComponents</b> and <b>FsmRxServices</b> using Schematics</h3>

  <p>To aid in the creation of FSMs, <b>NgxFsmRx</b> contains schematics to automate the production of the previously described types and configuration objects for both <b>FsmRxComponents</b> and <b>FsmRxServices</b>. 
  These schematics support both long-form and shorthand command syntax as follows:</p>
  
  ```shell
  ng generate ngx-fsm-rx:component
  ng generate ngx-fsm-rx:service
  ```
  <p>or</p> 
  ```shell
  ng g ngx-fsm-rx:c
  ng g ngx-fsm-rx:s
  ```
  
  <p>Both schematics guide through the process of defining states, transition rules and lifecycle hooks, while also generating the necessary class, template and story files.</p>

  <p>With this Simple Traffic Light component complete, you should have a good grasp of how to set up a basic FSM using FsmRx. 
  In ["Part 3 Modifying an existing FSM"](?path=/docs/3-modifying-an-existing-fsm--docs) we examine a key benefit of the module approach utilized in FSMs by adding a fourth state, demonstrating how easy FSMs are to update, restructure and maintain.</p>
